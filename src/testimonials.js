    body: `I would not have passed first time if it wasn't for the tuition I received from Martin. 
    Its as simple as that.
    I had a few instructors before hand and for whatever reason, in the most respectful way possible, I simply wasn't progressing enough.
    That wasn't the case with Martin.
    I would describe Martin as a professional, yet calming influence.
    He made sure I was stamping out bad habits and picking up good ones while I learned how to drive basically from scratch.
    Honestly, I couldn't recommend him highly enough.
    Thanks Martin!`,

    body: `Martin is a fantastic instructor and a very likeable person, he will make you feel at ease from the very first lesson. 
    Martin is a top professional instructor but also has that personal touch to make you feel like you're driving with a friend whilst learning.
    Honestly it's very easy for me to recommend him after passing but if you are torn between deciding who you want to take you forward I honestly wouldn't look any further than this guy.
    Thank you Marting for getting me my first time pass - Legend`,

    body: `Thankyou so much Martin, you're an absolute legend! 
    I cannot thank you enough, you have the patience of a saint, I'm not an easy person to teach but you made me feel at ease at all times.
    Answered all my questions and gave me the confidence to believe in myself!
    You were honest, straight forward and explained everything clearly to me.
    4 x 2 hour lessons and I passed first time round with 3 minors!
    Thank you again!
    I will be recommending you to everyone I know.`,

    I highly recommend Martin Flynn because he is a superb and very professional driving instructor.
    His level of teahing is something that cannot be matched!
    He makes the many aspects of driving a lot easier to understand, makes the manoeuvres a lot easier to perform, and generally makes learning to drive an exciting and rewarding experience.
    All in which makes the chances of passing your driving test all the more greater.
    I have only had a handful of lessons since I found Martin. After around a month's worth of lessons, I gained my confidence and was ready for my driving test.
    At the time of writing this review, I am holding my very own pass certificate.
    I'm now driving around in my own Peugot 407 SW (and soon to be driving more supercars for future film productions).
    I am an independent filmmaker and passing my test has opened me up to much wider oppurtunities.
    Martin is an ace guy!
    He is very friendly, very passionate in what he does and is someone who will help you to the fullest extent.
    You will not be dissapointed!`,

    body: `Thanks to Martin I managed to pass my test first time, despite multiple lock downs in the middle of lessons. 
    He is calm, composed and teaches at a high level so that once you learn it, you don't forget it. 
    He also boosts your confidence throughout your lessons, which has not only benefitted my driving but also with external environments. 
    The lessons were not only instructive and helpful, but they were also enjoyable.
    I would highly recommend Martin. Thanks again!`,

    body: `Martin is amazing!! 
    He was incredibly patient with me and no matter how annoying I was and saying I can't do it.
    Martin reassured me that I could! I would defiantly recommend going with Martin Flynn to anybody who asks.
    I passed my test with 0 minors and if that doesn't show how good of a driving instructor Martin is, I don't know what will!
    Thanks for everything you have done with me!!`,
